# Final submission for INFO-I 308: Information Representation

For the final project in my Database Infrastructure course, we were asked to deomnstrate our skills and understanding of Relation Database Mangement by building a full functioning database and information retrieval platform similar to the university's database. Using MySQL and LucidChart. 

In this process we:
1) Anayzed requirements and gathered information from our client (University professors) 
2) Designed a Conceptual Schema using an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)
3) Made a Logical Schema using the ERD.
4) Implemented the logical schema in a Relational Model using SQL
5) Wrote advanced queries to retrieve data from the database 
6) Wrote PHP scripts to build an interactive form
8) Participated in a team-based learning environment.
